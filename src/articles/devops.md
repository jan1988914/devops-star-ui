#  What is DevOps?
They say that ‘collaboration is the key to success’ in software development. DevOps does exactly that. It is a culture which promotes collaboration between the development team and the operations team. That is how the word “DevOps” has been derived. DevOps is one of the factors which makes an Agile software development company ‘Agile.’

We know that software delivery is no child’s play. That is why Agile organizations leverage DevOps to develop, test, deploy, and maintain an app with great speed, superior quality, and excellent control.

Agile organizations like Credencys offer DevOps as a service (DaaS) to serve those customers who deployed their apps without implementing DevOps. But, what is all the fuss? Why does software development require DevOps so badly?

Why DevOps is more than a need?
# 1 Shorter Development Time, Faster Delivery
Before DevOps, the development and operations team worked in different silos. Due to it, the project got finished with more number of development cycles or didn’t finish at all. Now, as the development and operations teams work together, the number of development cycles have been reduced.

Key Takeaway
It helped business and enterprises to reduce their application time-to-market. Which means now they have more time to test market penetration of their app. They can do more marketing experiments with their app than earlier.

# 2 Reduce Deployment Failures, Increase Recovery Time
DevOps increases the probability of finding errors in code. Faster the developers find a bug the quicker they will be able to solve it. DevOps not only makes development quicker but also reduces the risk of deployment failure as there will be minimum to almost none bugs in a code release.

Key Takeaway
It decreases rollbacks and increases the recovery time of an application. It will save developer’s time and energy as there will be lesser failures in every build release.

# 3 Better Communication
DevOps is a culture. A software development culture that enables development and operations team to work together to produce stunning results. This collaboration will increase the productivity of both developers and operations team.

Key Takeaway
The wait for results is no longer. The ritual of turning over the application to operations people and await the result will be over. Since the developers can fix bugs and build the app faster, the deployment team will deploy the app quicker and reduce time-to-market.

# 4 Higher Efficiency
DevOps helps developers to increase their programming efficiency. Development firms who follow DevOps are also using automation testing tools such as Selenium, Appium, Watir, etc. These tools help developers to identify the bugs quicker than manual testing methods.

Key Takeaway
The development process will become faster and less prone to errors at the same time.

# 5 Reduce Cost by Reducing IT Staff
DevOps benefits to both software development companies as well as their customers. It helps to reduce human resources required to develop software. With automation testing and faster development, businesses can now hire fewer developers and still deploy their app on-time.

Key Takeaway
DevOps helps business, start-ups, and enterprises to save money on their mobile app or web app development project.
